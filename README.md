# XYZ Store Customer Sentiment Analytics Dashboard 📊

## 📌 About This Project

### Overview
This project analyzes customer reviews and sentiment for XYZ Store, an e-commerce platform specializing in women's clothing. Using Power BI as a complete analytics environment, I transformed raw review data (including ratings, text, demographics, and product categories) into an interactive dashboard that reveals:

Overall review metrics → KPIs on total reviews, average rating, recommendation rate, positive sentiment, and customer demographics
Sentiment breakdown → Distribution of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments derived from review analysis
Performance by segments → Ratings and recommendations segmented by age groups, departments, and class names
Negative feedback insights → Identification of areas with higher dissatisfaction for targeted improvements

The dashboard includes filters for department, class name, division, and customer age to enable dynamic exploration. Sentiment classification (positive, neutral, negative) was performed based on rating thresholds and text analysis indicators.

- **Reviews Sentiment:** Pie chart breakdown - Positive: 927 (76.87%), Negative: 168 (13.93%), Neutral: 111 (9.20%). Overwhelmingly positive, but negative feedback warrants attention in specific areas.
- **Average Rating by Department:** Bar chart highlights Bottoms (4.2) and Intimate (4.2) as top performers, while Trend (3.8) and Dresses (3.8) lag behind.
Percentage Recommended by Department: Similar trends, with Bottoms leading at 0.88 and Trend/Dresses trailing at ~0.78.

📌 **Summary, Decisions, and Recommendations**

### **Summary**

- **Strengths:** High overall satisfaction (77% positive, 83% recommended), with strong performance in Bottoms and Intimate departments. Positive feedback is concentrated in practical classes like Layering and Legwear.
- **Key Risks:** Negative reviews (14%) highlight issues in Swim, Lounge, and Trend potentially related to fit, quality, or expectations. Declining ratings with age suggest products may not appeal as well to older demographics.
- **Opportunities:** Leverage filters for deeper analysis, e.g., by division or age, to identify niche improvements. High recommendation rates in top departments can drive repeat business and word-of-mouth.

### **Decisions to Consider**

- Investigate negative feedback in Swim and Lounge for quality enhancements (e.g., sizing, material).
- Tailor marketing to younger demographics while adapting products for 40+ age groups to boost ratings.
- Prioritize high-performing classes (e.g., Layering, Bottoms) in inventory and promotions.
- Expand sentiment analysis with advanced NLP on review text for more granular insights beyond ratings.

### **Recommendations**

- Conduct root cause analysis on low-rated classes like Swim and Trend to improve product quality.
- Develop age-specific marketing strategies to enhance satisfaction across demographics.
- Increase stock and promotions for top-rated departments to capitalize on positive sentiment.
- Integrate real-time review monitoring for proactive issue resolution.
